I stumbled on the [Beginner's Python Cheat Sheet for PyGame](http://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/cheatsheets/README.html) which ended up being exactly what I needed. I have struggled with sprite groups and seeing them along with other entry points on paper (or PDF) made a lot of things click for me. I highly recommend it.
