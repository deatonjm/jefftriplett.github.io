While researching ways to extend Click plug-ins, I stumbled on this [amazing tip](https://github.com/click-contrib/click-plugins/blob/master/README.rst#best-practices-and-extra-credit). Click options are reusable. I'm not sure why I never thought of this before but it's handy if you are writing dozens of click commands and you reuse the same options over and over.
