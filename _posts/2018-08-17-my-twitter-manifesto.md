This is more of a WIP than the ink being dry.

tl;dr My lingering thoughts about Twitter aka #birdsite for those on other networks.

I haven't decided if I'm going to participate in [#DeactiDay](https://twitter.com/monteiro/status/1028315475296452609) yet. I'm leaning towards it. However, the platform is still too important for many marginalized and underrepresented voices. It takes a tremendous amount of privilege to participate and to pretend that this problem is easily solved by jumping over to [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/). Participating is a personal choice and I respect you all regardless.

## Short-term

- I am on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@webology)

- All of my public Mastodon Toots are published on Twitter via [Moa](https://moa.party/)

- I am syncing my Twitter friends list via [Mastodon's Friends Bridge](https://bridge.joinmastodon.org/friends)

- I prefer a Twitter-like UI than Mastodon's default TweetDeck-like experience. Thankfully, [Pinafore](https://pinafore.social/) is another web client which has a more Twitter-like feel to it.

## Short to Medium-term

- I am participating in [#BlockParty500](https://twitter.com/shannoncoulter/status/1028632688586936320) using this [Block Together app+list](https://blocktogether.org/show-blocks/Jegy0TDm2gypbK-Tg1vGTh5KCJY2mxq_6iJ_hK2p). I am also proactively blocking advertisers who appear in my timeline.

- I am working on a Telegram Bot which will publish to Mastodon, Twitter, both, or whatever else comes out.

Why Telegram? I have been on the platform for a few months and have reconnected with friends who might otherwise not be on most social media websites. Their bot platform is great and I am a member of a few communities which aren't possible on a platform like Twitter.

## Long-term

The writing is on the wall that I don't want to be on Twitter unless there is a management change.
