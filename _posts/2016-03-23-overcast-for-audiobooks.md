The [Overcast podcast app](https://overcast.fm/) also makes a pretty decent audiobook client with the recent [upload feature](https://www.macstories.net/ios/overcast-2-5-adds-dark-theme-file-uploads/). Overcast's [Smart Speed feature saves me significantly amount of time](https://medium.com/@eped/overcasts-smart-speed-vs-real-time-a759549ab48b) without sacrificing voice quality.
