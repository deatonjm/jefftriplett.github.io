Last week I decided to write about my [Now][] page which I thought was a fun experiment. 

I had no idea if anyone actually read my blog outside of a few friends on Twitter. To my surprise, several friends were also inspired and created their own Now pages. 

I thought I'd highlight a few of these this week since I'm in the middle of trying to wrap up a few longer form blog posts. Enjoy!
