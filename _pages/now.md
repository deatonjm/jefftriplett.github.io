I'm home in Lawrence, Kansas. It's fall.

- I work full-time [REVSYS][] as an Engineer and Consultant. Some days I write code, train developers, automate systems, secure websites, and manage humans.

- We just wrapped up [DjangoCon US 2017][].

- I dabble with the Ukulele.

- After a few year hiatus, I am trail running again.

- I converted to a [Keto diet][] and lost ~30 lbs along the way.

- I have maintained a weekly [personal goals project][] on Github since late 2015. I'm continuing on into 2017 and the foreseeable future. 

- I'm attempting to blog more often in 2017. I didn't meet my goal of one post per week, but I'm determined to finish strong.

- I'm an avid basketball fan and [Is the Lead Safe][] if my website for tracking real-time game updates. I hope to resume working on it during the fall.

- I continue to watch [television][] and listen to [podcasts][].
