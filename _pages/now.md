I'm home in Lawrence, Kansas. It's winter.

- I work full-time [RevSys][] as a Software Engineer and Consultant. Some days I write code, train developers, automate systems, secure websites, and manage humans.

- I'm learning to play the Ukulele.

- After a few year hiatus, I recently started trail running again.

- For all of 2016, I maintained a weekly [personal goals project][] on Github. I'm continuing on into 2017 and the foreseeable future. 

- I'm attempting to blog once a week for every week in 2017.

- I'm an avid basketball fan and [Is the Lead Safe][] if my website for tracking real-time game updates. I'm hoping to find time to work on it more.

- I continue to watch [television][] and listen to [podcasts][].
