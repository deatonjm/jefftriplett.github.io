This is my personal website written with Markdown using Jekyll.


## Inspiration

- [Aaron Sumner's Now page](http://aaronsumner.com/pages/now.html)
- [Katy DeCorah's mind grapes.](https://github.com/katydecorah/katydecorah.github.io) I have picked up several great Jekyll / layout tips reading both Katy's blog and code. A++. My variation on playlists comes directly from Katy's blog.
